'''Given a maximum of 100 digit numbers as input, find the difference between the sum of odd and even position digits
Test Cases
Case 1

    Input: 4567
    Expected Output: 2

Explanation : Odd positions are 4 and 6 as they are pos: 1 and pos: 3, both have sum 10. Similarly, 5 and 7 are at even positions pos: 2 and pos: 4 with sum 12. Thus, difference is 12 â€“ 10 = 2
Case 2

    Input: 5476
    Expected Output: 2

Case 3

    Input: 9834698765123
    Expected Output: 1'''

n = [int(d) for d in str(input("Enter the number:"))]
a=0
b=0
for i in range(0,len(n)):
    
   if i%2==0:
      a+=n[i]
   else:
      b+=n[i]
    
print(abs(a-b))
